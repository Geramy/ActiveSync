- After kronolith gets support for different organizer/owner fields, must
  properly set the organizer for meeting responses. Currently, the event
  created from a meeting response does not contain the organizer of the original
  event. So when the event is sync'd back to the device, it allows the user
  to cancel the event and send updates to all attendees. Also, it will then be
  possible to automatically add responses to the kronolith event from the
  incoming activesync response message.

- Implement <SOFTDELETE> command. This removes items from the device that fall
  outside of the client's advertised timespan. This should only run once per
  day .. probably on the first connection of the day, or perhaps a randomized
  connection to lessen the chance of every user having this run at once.

- Email recurrence related properties for recurring meeting requests.

- Recipient Information Cache: Sync with Turba's favorites source.

- Email categories - possible to map to custom IMAP Flags?


BC BREAKING (i.e., Horde 6).
============================

- Move all non-specific constants to single class.
