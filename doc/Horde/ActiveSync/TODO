TODO for 2.0
============

- Monolithic state handling?
  Need to be able to tell PING state about SYNC state's synckey to more
  efficiently know the proper last_syncts values. So, the collection's PING
  state will *always* be loaded (for both SYNC and PING requests) and we can
  save the current SYNC syncKey into the colletion's PING state. NOTE: This
  might be unneccessary once we implement EAS 12.0 or 12.1
