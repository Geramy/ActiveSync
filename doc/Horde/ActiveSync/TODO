TODO for 2.0
============

- Implement Horde_ActiveSync_Folders for all collections, not just IMAP. These
  object shuttle state back and forth from backend driver to ActiveSync classes
  and are responsible for reporting changes from server.

  Folder contains *all* device state that the backend driver would need to
  generate a diff. Driver is responsible for providing all backend state data.

  So for mail, backend populates Folder with IMAP UIDS and flags, along with
  modseq values etc...

  The folder object is stored in the State driver's storage.

  For non-email folders, in Horde at least, Folder would only need to contain
  unsync'd changes etc...

- Monolithic state handling?
  Need to be able to tell PING state about SYNC state's synckey to more
  efficiently know the proper last_syncts values. So, the collection's PING
  state will *always* be loaded (for both SYNC and PING requests) and we can
  save the current SYNC syncKey into the colletion's PING state. NOTE: This
  might be unneccessary once we implement EAS 12.0 or 12.1
